Homologous Series Discoverer (HSD) is a tool (PythonGUI) designed to find the homologues series (HS) in a list (*.csv) of mass features (mass vs. RT), and it also ouput a list containing the m/z, KMD, and groups of the potential HS.

p.s. Part of the code is referred to the FindPFAS project (https://github.com/JonZwe/FindPFAS), and thanks to JonZwe!

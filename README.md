1) Homologous Series Discoverer (HSD) is a tool (PythonGUI) designed to find the homologues series (HS) in a list (*.csv, e.g. PFAS-Standard-65mix-50ppb.csv) of mass features (mass vs. RT), and it also ouput a list containing the m/z, KMD, and HS groups of the mass features.

2) Find HS Group (FHSG) is a tool aimed to find the valid HS (consistent m/z and RT) in a list (*.csv, e.g. target.csv) containing the mz, rt, HS number, and KMD. It output a list including all the combination (δmz>1, δrt>0.05).
 
3) p.s. Part of the code is referred to the FindPFAS project (https://github.com/JonZwe/FindPFAS). Thanks to JonZwe!
